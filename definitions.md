### Partition
A partition is a section of a hard drive that is seperated from other segments. These allow users to divide a physical disk into logical sections. 

### File System
See [filesystems.md](filesystems.md).

### Database
A structured way to organise data. Mobile devices often use SQLite - for example, applications such as Calendar, Text, Notes, Photos and Address Book use it on iOS.

### Plist 

A plist (property list) is a data file that stores information on iOS and OSX operating systems. A plsit can store strings, dates, boolean values, numbers and binary values. Browsing history, favourites and configuration data can be stored in a plist. (Plutil)[https://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/plutil/] can be used to convert binary plist files into a human readable format. 

### Slack Space

A source of unallocated space on a hard drive. File slack can be used to locate deleted files as deleting a file doesn't fully delete it - it just moves them. Hillary Clinton's deleted e-mails were found through investigators taking advantage of file slack.
